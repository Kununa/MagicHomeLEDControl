## C# API for LED controller controlled by the MagicHome app

Simple implementation of the protocol. I only tested it with a LD382 v2. Could implement more if someone is interested and able to help testing.


Protocol mostly taken from https://github.com/beville/flux_led and some sniffing.

Some parts are copied from https://github.com/beville/flux_led  and only translated into C#
